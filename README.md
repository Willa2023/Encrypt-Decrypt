# Encrypt And Decrypt Application
This is an application that provides encryption and decryption services, including Caesar cipher, DES, and AES encryption algorithms. The technology stack includes Java, JavaFX, MySQL, and Cloud services. It offers two storage options: local database and cloud database.
#
The app lets users register and log in, with passwords hashed in the database. After logging in, users can encrypt text using three methods. Encrypted text and message IDs are stored in the database, with encryption keys in local files. To decrypt, users log in, enter the message ID, and the app retrieves encrypted text and keys automatically. Clicking decrypt completes the process.
